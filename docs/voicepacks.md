# Generating a voice pack

The engineer sounds like a person only if it has recordings of one. This is how
to make them, using [`crew-chief-autovoicepack`][ccavp] — a Coqui XTTS v2
pipeline, MIT-licensed, whose folder layout PitRadio deliberately shares.

Before anything else, two facts that decide the rest of the plan:

* **The generator is Docker-only, and its GPU path is CUDA.** `--gpus all`, no
  ROCm and no Metal. On an AMD or Apple machine you are on `--cpu_only`, which
  the README puts at "12 hours or more" against "1 to 2 hours with a modern
  GPU".
* **It only reads the first ten seconds of each reference clip.** A long
  recording is not better input, it is nine wasted seconds — which is what
  [prepare_voice.py](../packaging/prepare_voice.py) exists to fix.

## 1. Get the reference audio right

Its README is blunt about this: "the source of your issues is very likely from
imperfections in the input audio recordings". The requirements are

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Format | 32-bit float PCM WAV, mono, 22.05 kHz |
| Clips | at least 3, at most 25, around 10 is right |
| Length | 10 seconds or less each — longer is silently truncated |
| Level | normalised to full scale |
| Silence | trimmed off both ends, and any pause over ~0.5s split into two clips |

The README writes the rate as "22.5 kHz", which is not a rate anything uses.
XTTS's reference rate is 22050 and that is what the tool below writes.

**You do not record the phrase list.** That is what the generator produces —
it needs about two minutes of you saying *anything*, and learns what you sound
like from it. [record_voice.py](../packaging/record_voice.py) walks through it,
ten clips of ten seconds, with a passage to read each time so nobody has to
invent one:

```bash
python packaging/record_voice.py --check                  # test the mic first
python packaging/record_voice.py --name Bono --reference
```

Every take is measured as it is saved and rejected on the spot if it clipped or
was too quiet, because finding out after forty takes is a session wasted.

**Or skip the cloning entirely.** `--phrases` reads the engineer's 171 lines
and writes a finished pack of real human speech — no GPU, no Docker, no
renting anything, and better than any synthesiser will manage. It takes about
half an hour of reading:

```bash
python packaging/record_voice.py --name Bono --phrases --out voices
```

The README says not to obsess over emotional range while reading, "as the xtts
model tends to diminish those aspects anyway".

If you have recordings already — a phone memo, a download — this converts
them instead:

```bash
python packaging/prepare_voice.py --name Bono recordings/*.wav
```

It reads anything FFmpeg reads (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, a `yt-dlp` download),
mixes to mono, resamples, splits on pauses, trims, cuts to ten seconds,
normalises each clip on its own and writes `baseline/Bono/1.wav`… Decoding goes
through PyAV, which is already a dependency, so this costs the project nothing.

It refuses rather than guesses if fewer than three usable clips come out.

**Check them before spending an hour of GPU on them:**

```bash
python packaging/prepare_voice.py --verify baseline/Geoff
```

Every requirement is measured off the file rather than trusted — format, rate,
channels, length, clipping and signal-to-noise. A clip dropped in by hand from
an audio editor looks identical in a folder listing and produces a clone that
is subtly wrong for no visible reason.

**On cloning somebody else.** The generator's README has no ethics or licensing
section at all — I checked — and actively suggests pulling a voice from a
YouTube video or imitating "a professional voice actor you choose". That is its
position, not this project's. A voice is a likeness, and a pack cloned from a
real person is fine to keep on your own machine and is not something to publish
or ship. PitRadio will not distribute one.

## 2. Rent a GPU, if you need to

Renting an hour of an NVIDIA card is cheaper than leaving a CPU running
overnight, and avoids installing WSL2. Any provider works; these are the steps
on RunPod, which is what this was tested against.

1. **Deploy a Pod** — GPU Cloud, any card with **8GB or more**. The model needs
   ~2.6GB of VRAM, so almost anything qualifies; an RTX 4090 gets you the
   README's 8-replicas-in-parallel figure, an A4000 or 3090 is plenty for one.
2. **Template**: anything CUDA with Docker available, or run the image
   directly. Give it **60GB of disk** — the image alone is ~15GB and each pack
   is ~2GB.
   **Your API key goes in RunPod's own config, never in this repo.** Either
   `runpodctl config --apiKey <key>`, which writes `~/.runpod/config.toml`, or
   the `RUNPOD_API_KEY` environment variable. A key in a tree that is pushed to
   GitHub is a key that has already leaked, which is why the relay's secrets
   are handled the same way — see the note in `.gitignore`.

3. **Upload the baseline clips.** They are a few megabytes:

   ```bash
   runpodctl send baseline/Bono
   ```

   or `scp -P <port> -r baseline/Bono root@<host>:/workspace/baseline/`.

4. **Run it**, from the pod's shell:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
     -v /workspace/output:/app/output \
     -v /workspace/baseline:/app/baseline \
     -v /workspace/phrase_inventory.csv:/app/phrase_inventory.csv \
     ghcr.io/cktlco/crew-chief-autovoicepack:latest
   ```

   then, at its prompt:

   ```bash
   python3 generate_voice_pack.py --your_name 'Champ' --voice_name 'Bono'
   ```

   `--your_name` is what the engineer calls *you*; keep it generic if the pack
   will ever be shared.

5. **Bring it back**: `runpodctl send /workspace/output/Bono`, and **stop the
   pod**. A pod left running bills whether or not anything is generating.

Budget roughly an hour of GPU time per voice, plus the image pull. The process
is restartable and idempotent — existing files are skipped unless `--overwrite`
— so a pod that dies mid-run costs only what it had not finished.

## 3. Use PitRadio's phrase list, not Crew Chief's

The shipped `phrase_inventory.csv` has ~9,100 rows of Crew Chief's own
vocabulary. PitRadio says a different set of things, so generating theirs would
take hours to produce phrases the engineer never uses and none of the ones it
does.

The Engineer tab writes the right list: **Write phrase list**, which produces
`phrase_inventory.csv` in the voice packs folder — 171 phrases at 3 takes,
about 513 clips, a few minutes of GPU time rather than hours. Mount it over the
container's own, as in the command above.

It is generated from `lines.vocabulary()` rather than kept by hand, so it cannot
drift from what the engineer actually says — and a test asserts that every
fragment of every kind of call appears in it. That check is the reason the list
is worth trusting: a phrase the inventory never asked for is a word the pack
does not have, and the engineer drops into the Windows voice for it in the
middle of a sentence.

**Numbers are in the list**, and that is why lap times are built from fragments
rather than spoken as one phrase — see [engineer.md](engineer.md). Sixty-odd
number clips cover every lap time there is.

## 4. Throw away the takes it got wrong

**Do this before listening to anything.** XTTS rambles on short text, and its
own integrity check cannot tell — that check asks whether the audio is valid
speech, not whether it is the phrase that was asked for. From the first real
pack generated here, the three takes of "fifteen" came out:

    0.39s    2.54s    12.57s

All three scored 1.00. A pack picks between takes at random, so that is a
one-in-three chance of twelve seconds of nonsense on a call.

```bash
python packaging/clean_pack.py voices/Geoff --dry-run   # see what would go
python packaging/clean_pack.py voices/Geoff
```

It judges each take against **its siblings** — a phrase recorded three times
should take about as long three times — and falls back on what the words
themselves can account for when every take rambled. Nothing is deleted;
rejected takes move to `<pack>-rejected/` so you can listen to what went.

On that first pack it rejected 97 of 513 takes (19%) and left every one of the
171 phrases with at least one recording. A phrase is never emptied: no takes
means falling back to the Windows voice mid-sentence, which is worse than the
least-bad recording.

## 5. Install it

Drop the folder into the voice packs directory — the Engineer tab's **Open
folder** button goes straight there — and pick it in the Voice list. Its name is
the folder's name.

A pack does not need to be complete. Anything it does not have is synthesised
by the Windows voice, so a half-generated pack works and simply falls back more
often. Driver names always do, in every pack, because no generated set can
contain them.

## Recording on a headset mic

Perfectly usable, and the most common thing people have. Three things decide
whether it works:

* **Off to the side of your mouth**, a couple of finger widths away — not in
  front of it. A boom mic directly in the airflow clips on every *p* and *b*,
  and clipping cannot be undone afterwards.
* **A quiet room.** `--check` measures the noise floor and tells you; a fan or
  a PC under the desk ends up in every clip and therefore in the cloned voice.
* **Consistent distance.** Do not lean around between takes. The model averages
  what it hears, and clips recorded at four different distances average into
  something that sounds like none of them.

Windows' own microphone boost is worth turning **off** — it is a compressor,
and it pumps the room noise up between words.
