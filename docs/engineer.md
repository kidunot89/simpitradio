# The engineer

A named voice that watches the sim and talks to you: your lap times, cars
alongside, and answers when you ask it something.

It shares the trigger with everything else SimPitRadio does. Hold the trigger,
say "Chief, focus on P3", let go. That one goes to the engineer instead of the
chat box, and the engineer answers.

**It is off until you switch it on.** Nothing is spoken until you have been to
Settings → Engineer and ticked the box.

---

## Quick start

1. Open **Settings → Engineer** and tick **Engineer on**.
2. Pick one of the four engineers. That sets its name, its voice and how much
   it talks.
3. Press **Test**. You should hear it say its name back.
4. Set the **Output device** to your headset. Use the one you wear for voice
   chat rather than the sim's output.
5. Drive. It will read your lap time out at the line.
6. Hold the trigger and say **"Chief, focus on P3"** to be measured against
   whoever is third.

If Test says nothing, see [Nothing is spoken](#nothing-is-spoken) at the bottom.

## Talking to it

Two ways a sentence becomes a command, and both are deliberately narrow. The
same key sends messages to everyone in your session, so a command the engineer
*invents* is a message that silently never arrives.

**Say its name first.** "Chief, focus on P3." The name comes first, the phrase
comes straight after it. `hey`, `ok` and `right` are allowed in front of the
name.

**Or say a phrase on its own**, as long as it runs to two words and takes no
driver. "coach me" works with nothing in front of it. "study" is one word, it
could open an ordinary sentence, and everything after it is the driver's name,
so it needs the engineer's name first. Said bare, *study P2* went to the chat
box eight times in one session, resolved into a driver mention and sent to
everybody.

Saying just the name gets "go ahead", the way a real radio would, and keeps a
stray *Chief* out of a message to twenty other people.

**"stop"** always works, whatever is running and whatever started it. So do
"stand down", "cancel", "that's enough" and "forget it".

Anything the engineer does not recognise is a message, and goes to the chat box
exactly as it did before.

## Choosing an engineer

Four ship with the app:

| | Voice | Style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chief** | male | Steady and complete. "Turn four, Tandy was faster on the exit, two tenths." |
| **Ada** | female | Clipped. Drops the corner number: "Tandy, faster exit, two tenths." |
| **Marshall** | male | Slower and fuller, if the others feel rushed. |
| **Vic** | female | Quick and short. The least talking of the four. |

Each is a preset: a name, a preferred Windows voice, a pace, and how much it
says. None of them is a recording. A generated voice pack runs to one or two
gigabytes, so four sets of audio would be an eight gigabyte download to replace
something already on every Windows machine for free.

Each one picks the best installed Windows voice matching its preference and your
language. A stock Windows 11 install usually has two or three, so two engineers
may share a voice and differ by pace and phrasing. Set **Windows voice** to
override the preset.

**Called** is what it answers to. Set it to anything. The name is only used for
addressing it, and "Bob, focus on P3" works exactly as well.

---

## What it tells you

### Lap times

Reads your lap out as you cross the line, and says when it was your best. On by
default.

### Spotter

Calls cars alongside: "car left", "car right", "in the middle" with one either
side, then "clear" once they have gone. Off by default, and there is one thing
to know about it.

**Which side is which could not be verified without a car on a track.** The
positions come from the sim's own world coordinates, and whether the maths comes
out as left or right depends on a handedness convention this project could not
check from a development machine. If it calls a car on your right to your left,
turn on **Swap spotter sides** in Profiles, under the game's session plugin
settings. It is one tick, once.

Everything else about the spotter is exact. It uses in-game positions, it drops
height, so a bridge or the Le Mans esses does not put somebody on your door, and
it does not call cars on an adjacent straight.

### Damage

Says what has broken and whether to come in for it. On by default, and it needs
a sim that publishes car condition. Today that is Le Mans Ultimate.

> *You have lost bodywork. Box this lap.*

**It speaks on the moment the car gets worse, then stays quiet.** A driver
carrying a dented left rear for half an hour does not need reminding of it each
time round. Every part of the reading is watched rather than the worst of them,
so a second thing coming off a car that was already dented is news even though
the severity has not moved.

**What it says is where, then whether.** You already know you hit something.
What you cannot see from the seat is how bad it is and whether there is time to
fix it, so it names the place: the nose, the tail, down the left side. Then it
gives one of three answers.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Box this lap** | the car cannot be raced, only nursed in: a part hanging off, a puncture, a wheel gone, or a broken nose. No amount of time left changes this — the alternative is a black flag or a wall |
| **Box when you can** | worth fixing. Always in practice and qualifying, where a stop costs nothing and the point of being out is a car that works |
| **Stay out, we will live with it** | a race with under a fifth of it to run. Three laps from home you are better off nursing a bad car to the flag than handing back a minute |

Light damage gets the first half and no advice at all. Being told to weigh a
stop for a scuffed rear quarter is worse than being told nothing.

It never speaks over the coach. Damage is urgent, and you want to know the wing
has gone before the next corner rather than after it. A critique you asked for
is still not worth cutting for a car that will be broken just as thoroughly in
four seconds. The spotter is the only call that talks over anything.

---

## Who it watches

The engineer keeps a **focus**: one driver it measures you against. You do not
have to set it. By default it is **the car ahead in your class**, or the car
behind when you are leading it. Nobody is ahead to chase there, and the question
has become whether you are keeping them behind.

It only follows a change once the position has **held for eight seconds**.
Positions churn. Measured at a live race start, fifteen different drivers were
the car ahead inside ninety seconds, every switch threw away the laps the
watcher had gathered, and it never had enough to say anything at all.

Say so if you want somebody else:

- `focus on {driver}`, or "keep an eye on", "keep tabs on", "study", "watch"
- `default focus`, back to choosing on its own
- `stop focusing`, off until you ask it back

A driver you name is never overruled. Wandering back to whoever is ahead two
corners later is the app disagreeing with you.

The Status tab shows who is being watched, and `what are we watching` asks.

---

## Asking it things

Every question has a box of phrases in Settings → Engineer, one per line, and
whatever you type replaces the defaults. Each can be switched off; a question
that is off contributes no phrases at all, so its words reach the chat box like
any others rather than being taken and answered with nothing.

- **Your car**: `what's my best lap`, `how are the tyres`, `what's the damage`,
  `how's the fuel`, `how much fuel do I need to finish the race when I pit on
  the next lap`
- **The session**: `who has the fastest lap`, `who's fastest`,
  `who has the fastest sector`, `who's in the lead`, `who's ahead`
- **Where the time goes**: `where am I slower`, `where am I faster`, either of
  them with `than {driver}` on the end

**Questions jump the queue.** A question asked while the engineer is mid-call
used to wait behind it or be dropped outright, because the queue holds six and
a busy lap fills it. You asked, heard it talking about something else, and got
no answer. An answer now clears the ordinary traffic, cuts what is being said,
and cannot be squeezed out. It still yields to the spotter, because a car
alongside is about not crashing.

**A question it cannot answer stays out of the chat box.** *Who's faster?* is
not a phrase it knows, and it used to fall through and go out to the session.
Anything that reads as a question, by ending in a question mark or opening with
an interrogative, is answered "say again" instead. There is a tick box on the
Text chat tab if you would rather have the old behaviour. A question you have
explicitly switched off still reaches chat, because switching it off is how you
say those words are yours.

You can put the engineer's name at either end: "Bono, how are the tyres" and
"how are the tyres, Bono" both work. The comma is what marks it as a name, so
`focus on Bono` still focuses on a driver called Bono.

### Where am I slower

The one worth knowing about. It compares you with your focus **corner by
corner, averaged over every lap this session** rather than read off one. A
single lap says what happened on that lap, and the question is about what keeps
happening.

> Chief, where am I slower
>
> *Turn three, you are slower on entry, two tenths.*
>
> *Turn seven, they have a better exit, a tenth.*

It says *how* as well as where: entry, exit, braking later, or slower through
the whole corner. Where a catalogue exists for the circuit it uses the name,
*Eau Rouge* rather than *turn three*.

**How it finds corners.** There is no track map and there is not going to be
one. A map needs a file per circuit, goes stale with every layout change, and
works on the four tracks somebody got round to. A corner is a place where the
reference lap slowed down and sped back up, which is true on every circuit in
every sim. Chicanes count as one corner.

**It describes what it measured.** *They have a better exit* is what the app
knows. Whether that was line, tyres or a tow it has no way of telling, and
*brake later* would be a guess wearing the clothes of coaching.

**If laps are missing it says whose.** Yours or theirs, because "no laps to
compare" on its own leaves you guessing which.

### What it will not use as a reference

- A lap with any part of it in the pit lane. A quick lap that was really a
  shortcut through the pits would otherwise become the target everybody is
  measured against, and nothing about it would look wrong.
- A lap you joined halfway through.
- A lap the sim gave no time for, such as an out lap or a car that has just
  arrived.
- Anything from a different track. Changing circuit clears everything.

It also stays quiet while you are spectating. Commenting on a lap you are
watching rather than driving would be nonsense.

---

## When your sim cannot answer

Sims publish different things, and the engineer says so rather than guessing.
Original Assetto Corsa publishes **your own car and nothing about anybody
else**: no other driver's name, position or lap time. Anything comparing you
with the grid has no data there by any route.

Ask "who's leading" and it answers **"this game doesn't say"**. That is a
different answer from "nobody to watch", which means the grid really is empty.
Tell a driver sitting seventh that nobody is ahead of them and you have told
them something false.

Behaviours that need data your sim does not supply are skipped with a line in
the log rather than left switched on and silent:

```
Spotter is on but this sim does not publish positions or spotter; it will stay quiet
```

`--telemetry` prints what your sim is actually sending. See the last section.

---

## Other languages

The engineer speaks whatever language you have set for **transcription**, unless
you pin it on the Engineer tab. Your commands arrive through Whisper, so an
engineer listening for English phrases while Whisper produces Spanish will never
hear a single one.

Everything it says goes through the same translation catalogues as the window,
and so do the phrases it listens for. Adding a language is a JSON file in
`src/pitradio/locale/`; see the main README.

**Numbers are spelled out in English and read as digits everywhere else.**
Number grammar is per-language. German inverts the tens and units, Spanish
fuses the twenties, and a half-done implementation would produce confident
nonsense in somebody's own language. Digits hand the problem to the speech
voice for that language, which already solves it. One consequence: a
non-English voice pack cannot cover numbers, and they come out synthesised.

---

## Voice packs

**Which pack this engineer speaks from is set here, on the Engineer tab**, and
the coach picks its own on the Coaching tab. They are separate jobs, and a
driver can reasonably want to hear which of the two is talking.

**Installing, recording and removing packs is Settings → Voice.** A pack is
something the app holds. Which of them a voice speaks from is a setting on that
voice.

Two packs ship with it, **Norman** and **Claudia**, both generated with Piper.
See [voicepacks.md](voicepacks.md). Either can be replaced by a pack of your
own.

A voice pack puts recorded audio in place of the Windows voice: a folder of WAV
files, one folder per phrase, several takes each. The engineer picks a take at
random, which is most of why a pack sounds like a person.

**The layout is Crew Chief's**, on purpose:

```
%APPDATA%\pitradio\voices\
  Ada\
    voice\
      corners\
        two_tenths\
          a.wav
          b.wav
```

A flat `<pack>/<phrase>/*.wav` works too, which is what you get from recording
your own.

So a pack generated by
[crew-chief-autovoicepack](https://github.com/cktlco/crew-chief-autovoicepack)
can be dropped straight in. To generate one for SimPitRadio's phrases rather
than Crew Chief's:

1. Settings → **Voice** → **Write phrase list**. This writes
   `phrase_inventory.csv` into the voices folder, in the engineer's language.
2. Feed that inventory to the generator in place of its own.
3. Put the output folder under `voices\` and pick it on the Engineer tab
   (or use **Settings → Voice → Open voice pack folder** to get there).

**Names and numbers are never in a pack** and are always spoken by the Windows
voice. No pack can hold every driver's name or every lap time, so a call like
*turn four, Tandy was faster on the exit* is part recorded and part
synthesised. That seam is audible. It is still the right trade, because the
alternative is a pack that goes unused the moment a driver is named, which is
most calls.

Packs are stored beside your config rather than in the install directory, so an
update does not delete a gigabyte of audio you chose to install.

---

## How it fits together

The engineer runs on **its own thread**, separate from the four SimPitRadio
already has, and speaking gets a thread below that. Neither can hold up the
keyboard hook, the worker, or the window.

Everything it does is allowed to fail. The engineer going quiet must never cost
you a trigger, a transcription, or a message in the chat box. If anything in
here breaks, the words go to the chat box as they always did and the problem is
a line in the log.

It reads the sim ten times a second through the same plugin that supplies driver
names for mentions. There is no second data path and no extra connection to the
game.

---

## Nothing is spoken

**Test does nothing.** The synthesiser runs in a PowerShell host using
`System.Speech`, which is part of the .NET Framework on every Windows 10 and 11
machine. Check the log for `no speech host`. A locked-down machine with
PowerShell blocked is the usual cause.

**You can hear it, but not in your headset.** Set the Output device on the
Audio tab. It defaults to the system default, which during a race is often the
wheel's speaker.

**It reads lap times and never coaches.** The coach needs a reference lap, and
until your focus has completed one cleanly, with no part of it in the pit lane,
there is nothing to compare against.

**It coaches and says nothing at some corners.** Those corners cost less time
than the threshold, which is the design. `engineer.coach_threshold` in
`config.json` is how much time in half a corner is worth interrupting for, in
seconds; lower it for more calls. There is no control for it in the window.

**It answers to nothing you say.** Check the name on the Engineer tab, and
remember that any phrase taking a driver needs the name in front of it. Say
*Chief* on its own. If you get "go ahead", it is listening and the phrase is
the problem.

**It ate a message.** It should not. If the engineer took something you meant
to send, the log line says `that was for the engineer` along with what it
matched. Please open an issue with that line: the matcher being too eager is
the one bug in this feature that costs something real.

---

## Checking what your sim is actually sending

Most of the time the engineer says nothing, the engineer is not the problem.
Start the game, get **on track and moving**, then:

```bash
python -m pitradio --telemetry
```

It prints every car as the engineer sees it: lap distance, speed, lap count,
sector, lap times, pit flag, world position. Then it compares consecutive reads
and tells you whether any of it is changing.

That second part is the one to read. A sim paused or sitting in a menu keeps
publishing a block that looks completely healthy, with plausible cars,
positions and speeds. Nothing moves, so the engineer has nothing to say, and no
single snapshot shows it. If it reports

> Nothing changed across 4 reads, including the sim's own clock.

then the game is paused, in a menu, or the session has ended. Nothing is
broken.

What to look for when it *is* live:

| Column | Feeds |
| --- | --- |
| `lapdist`, `speed` | corner detection, and where the time goes |
| `lap`, `last lap`, `best lap` | lap time and fastest lap calls |
| `sec` — changes three times a lap | every sector call |
| `world x/y/z` — different per car | the spotter |

The `provides:` line at the top says which of those the session plugin claims
to supply. A behaviour that needs something absent is skipped rather than left
switched on and silent, and the log names what is missing.

## What each sim can do

Sims publish very different things, and a behaviour whose data is missing is
**skipped with a line in the log** rather than left switched on and silent.

| | Le Mans Ultimate | iRacing | Assetto Corsa / Competizione / Evo | Automobilista 2, Project CARS 2 / 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lap times | yes | yes | yes | derived |
| New fastest lap | yes | yes | — | yes |
| Sector calls | yes | — | yes | — |
| Where am I slower | any driver | any driver | your own best | any driver |
| Who is ahead / leading | yes | yes | — | yes |
| Spotter | geometry | the sim's own call | Competizione only | geometry |
| Driver mentions, "P3" | yes | yes | — | yes |
| Damage | yes | — | — | — |
| Coaching and the segment diagram | yes | — | — | — |

Every gap in that table is the game's:

- **iRacing** publishes no per-car sector splits, so sector calls have nothing
  to work from. Its spotter is the best of the lot: `CarLeftRight` comes from
  the real car bodies, so it needs no swap setting and no width guess.
- **Assetto Corsa** publishes lap times for your car only and no driver names
  at all. There are no standings and no mentions there, and "where am I slower"
  chases your own best lap, which is what a practice session is for anyway.

  The original game goes further and publishes **no other car at all**, down to
  the position. Checked against a live eight-car race, the coordinate array held
  the player in slot zero and untouched memory in every other: zeros, a NaN, a
  denormal. The spotter has nothing to work from there either. The session
  plugin decides this per session rather than per game, because **Competizione
  does** publish the array and the same plugin reports positions for it.
- **Automobilista 2 and Project CARS** carry lap *counts* rather than lap times
  in the part of their block worth trusting, so lap times are measured here
  with a stopwatch. A lap that spans a pause comes out longer than it was,
  which fails safe: an inflated lap never becomes the reference a comparison
  chases. Their sector field is an enum that could not be pinned down from
  outside the games, so sector calls are not offered.

Automobilista 2 has its own entry rather than sharing the Project CARS one, so
you can pick the game you are actually running and so the two keep separate
spotter and proximity settings.

**Le Mans Ultimate is the only one verified against the running game.** Every
other reader is unverified: tested against shared memory built by hand, which
catches a wrong field width, a mis-decoded name or a padding mistake, and
cannot catch a wrong assumption about what the sim puts where. Run
`--telemetry` with the game on track before trusting any of them, and Assetto
Corsa Evo especially, which is still early access and may move its layout.

**iRacing is marked experimental**, and shows as such in the profile picker.
The code is no worse than the rest. Nobody working on SimPitRadio owns a copy,
so it is the one session plugin that will not get checked against the real
thing unless somebody who has it runs `--telemetry` and says what came back. If
that is you, please do; the note in the plugin list asks for exactly that.

## Per-sim settings

Three of the engineer's numbers live on the **profile**, under the game's
session plugin settings, because they describe the game rather than your taste:

- **Swap spotter sides**, for when a car on your right is called to your left
- **Spotter overlap (metres)**: how far apart along the track still counts as
  side by side. A Hypercar is about 5m long
- **Spotter width (metres)**: how far to the side counts, before they are
  simply on another part of the circuit

Car lengths and axis conventions differ between sims, so a number that suits
one game is wrong in the next.

## Flags and incidents

A behaviour of its own, kept apart from the spotter deliberately. Crew Chief's
own sound folders draw the line in the right place: `car_left`, `still_there`
and `clear_all_round` sit in `spotter/`, while `stopped_car_in_turn_3`,
`slow_car_ahead` and `local_yellow_ahead` sit in `flags/`. The spotter answers
who is beside you, which is geometry. Flags answer what has happened to the
track, which is something else.

Deriving the second from the first produced a warning in every braking zone.
SimPitRadio had a rule saying a car much slower than you was a hazard, and a
braking zone is precisely where the car in front is much slower than you. That
rule is gone.

**Three sources, not equally trustworthy.**

*Full-course yellow* and *blue* come from the sim and are reliable. LMU's
`mGamePhase`, `mYellowFlagState` and per-car `mFlag` all read sanely against a
live session.

*Local yellows are derived*, because LMU's `mSectorFlag` is not usable. It is
documented as "whether there are any local yellows at the moment in each
sector" and reads `[11, 11, 1]` under a green flag, with the fields either side
of it correct. No offset has slipped; LMU publishes something else there. Read
as booleans it would put a permanent yellow on the whole circuit. So an
incident here means what a marshal means by one: a car has stopped on the road
and has been there two seconds. That is a derivation from data the sim does
publish honestly, in the same spirit as finding the corners in the speed trace
rather than shipping a track map.

The cost is that the call cannot precede the incident. A real yellow is out the
moment the marshals see it, and this one waits to be sure. The benefit is that
it is never wrong about a green track, which is the failure that makes people
turn a feature off.

**Incidents are named by corner rather than by driver.** At the speed this
matters, *turn six* is something a driver can act on and a name is a syllable
count they cannot afford. The numbering is the lap book's, so a driver hears one
set of corner numbers across every feature. The corners are found once per
reference lap and cached, because `find_corners` resamples a whole lap and this
runs several times a second. With no reference lap yet the sector is named
instead.

**When you are the incident, the side calls stop.** Describing the cars going
past a spun car back to its driver is noise. The only useful question is
whether there is room to pull out, and `rejoin.py` answers it by comparing
*time to be safe* against *time until the next car arrives*. A stationary car
needs its whole acceleration back before the first arrival, which is why an
answer built on three seconds of clear track gets people collected.

Two guards, both learned rather than assumed. Nothing is said in the pit lane,
where being stationary is the point. Nothing is said before the car has ever
moved either: sitting on the grid before the lights is stationary, on the
racing line, with the whole field behind, which is every input the rejoin
advice looks at.

See [voicepacks.md](voicepacks.md) for generating a voice.

## Questions

Behaviours and questions are different things, and the difference shows in the
tab. A behaviour is something the engineer *keeps doing*, listed under [What it
tells you](#what-it-tells-you), and it carries a repeat interval, because a car
alongside stops being there without anything happening. A question has an
answer, and once the answer has been given there is nothing running. Model one
as the other and "who has the fastest lap" lands in the Behaviours list, where
every entry repeats. There is no such thing as answering a question again every
1.2 seconds.

Three of them: the fastest lap, the fastest sector, and your own best.

**The parameter follows the keyword and is never part of the phrase.** What a
driver can ask about depends on the sim they are in: the classes on this grid,
the sectors this circuit has. None of that belongs in a phrase somebody typed
into a settings box. "who has the fastest sector" is the phrase, and *three in
GT3* is what came after it, parsed against the session. A class is matched
through `mentions.class_aliases`, so LMU's *LMGT3* answers to *GT3* exactly as
it does everywhere else, and *LMP2* still refuses to answer to *P2* because
that is a position.

**A closed argument space is the false-positive defence**, and it beats
counting words. `phrases.MIN_BARE_WORDS` protects the spoken commands by
demanding two words in front of an open-ended parameter. That is not enough
here: *who has the fastest lap of my life that one* clears it easily and would
be taken as a question about a class called *of my life that one*, swallowing
the message. A question's argument can only be a class on this grid, a sector
between one and three, or nothing at all. Anything else was never a question,
whatever it started with. Addressed by name it is one regardless, because
somebody who said the engineer's name was talking to it.

**No class named means your own class**, which is what somebody in a GT3 car
asking "who has the fastest lap" means. A class named that nobody is in gets
told so rather than being quietly answered with the overall figure. A wrong
answer stated confidently is the failure with no symptom.

Each has a tick-box on the Engineer tab and nothing else. What a question can
be asked about is fixed by what the sim publishes, so an editable phrase box
there would imply you could invent one.

The switch earns its place elsewhere. **Every phrase the engineer listens for
is a phrase that can be taken out of a message meant for the whole session**,
and somebody who never asks these has no reason to carry that risk. Switching
one off removes its phrases from the matcher entirely rather than silencing it
downstream. Silencing it downstream would lift "who has the fastest lap" out of
the message and then answer with nothing, which is the worst of both. Missing
from the config means on, so adding a question never needs a migration.

## The spotter, and where its numbers come from

Every threshold in `spotter.py` is Crew Chief's, read out of a local
installation rather than guessed at. Its `ui_text/en.txt` names each setting
and `CrewChiefV4.exe.config` ships the defaults:

| Ours | Crew Chief's | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEFAULT_CAR_LENGTH` | `lmu_spotter_car_length` | 4.5 (5 for pcars2/ACC, 4.4 for AMS2) |
| `GAP_FOR_CLEAR` | `spotter_gap_for_clear` | 0.5 m |
| `OVERLAP_DELAY` | `spotter_overlap_delay` | 50 ms |
| `CLEAR_DELAY` | `spotter_clear_delay` | 150 ms |
| `MIN_SPEED` | `min_speed_for_spotter` | 10 m/s |
| `MAX_CLOSING_SPEED` | `max_closing_speed_for_spotter` | 12 m/s |
| the repeat interval | `spotter_hold_repeat_frequency` | 3 s |

Three of those were missing here entirely and each was causing a fault the
driver could feel:

**The closing-speed limit is what catches the lapping car.** Something arriving
12 m/s quicker crosses the whole overlap window in well under a second, so by
the time the call has been spoken they have gone, and the driver holds a line
for a car that is no longer there.

**The minimum speed is what stops the pit lane and the grid.** Below 10 m/s the
cars around you are stationary or passing at walking pace, and calling those is
how a spotter ends up switched off.

**The two settling delays are what stop the chatter.** Two cars at the same
corner cross in and out of overlap as they breathe. The delays are deliberately
different lengths: the overlap delay is short because a warning that is late is
worthless, and the clear delay is longer because it can afford to be sure. A
driver who holds their line a tenth longer than necessary has lost nothing.

The clear range is `car length + gap` rather than a second multiple of the
length. It matters at the extremes: for a kart, a further car length is two
metres of hysteresis and the call hangs on far too long, while half a metre of
daylight is half a metre whatever you are driving.

**The spotter is silent under a full-course yellow**, which is Crew Chief's
`fcy_stop_spotter_immediately` and on by default. The field is bunched at a
crawl and permanently overlapping, so every call would be true and useless.

### What it says

The vocabulary is Crew Chief's `Sounds/voice/spotter/` folder, so a voice pack
built for Crew Chief speaks all of it without a mapping: `car_left`,
`car_right`, `still_there`, `hold_your_line`, `in_the_middle`, `clear_left`,
`clear_right`, `clear_all_round`, `three_wide_on_left`, `three_wide_on_right`.

Two of those replaced calls that stated the same fact the harder way round:

* **"three wide you're on the right"** was *two cars left*. A driver hearing
  the old one has to work out where that leaves them, while they are busy. The
  new one says which way there is no room.
* **"in the middle"** was *three wide*, for one car either side.

A repeat says `still there` on one side and `hold your line` on both, because
those are different instructions: one means do not move that way, the other
means do not move. The arrival and its repeats share a key derived from the
*counts*, so the repeat interval governs them. A key that changed with the
wording would make the follow-up a new call, due on the very next tick.

**The oval set is deliberately absent**: `car_inside`, `clear_outside`,
`three_wide_on_inside`. Which side is inside is a fact about the banking, which
none of the sims here publish and which Crew Chief keeps per-track. A guess at
it is a call that is confidently the wrong way round.

### Fuel

"how much fuel do I need to finish the race when I pit" takes the stop as its
argument: *on the next lap*, or *in five laps*. **The answer is a percentage**,
because that is the number on the sim's own fuel screen and the driver has
about four seconds on the way to the pit entry to dial it in. Litres are the
working.

**Consumption is measured.** A car's use depends on the circuit, the fuel map,
the traffic and how the person is driving it, so litres-per-lap here is what
*this* car has been using over *these* laps. It is a short rolling average, so
it follows a change of fuel map rather than being dragged back by a whole
stint. Until a lap has been completed there is no answer and it says so. A fuel
number invented from nothing is the one wrong answer here that ends somebody's
race.

Three details worth writing down:

* **The laps before the stop are not fuelled for.** What is in the tank now
  covers those. Only the ones after it are the question, which is why this
  never reads the current level.
* **`mMaxLaps` is `INT_MAX` in a timed session.** Taken at face value it asks
  for two billion laps' worth. `SessionInfo` carries `max_laps` *or* `ends_at`,
  never both, and the session plugin decides which. The engineer never guesses
  the missing one. A timed race divides the remaining clock by the driver's own
  best lap and rounds **up**, because the flag falls at the end of the lap you
  are on when the clock runs out.
* **A fill above the tank's capacity is reported rather than clipped.** It
  means the stop cannot be the last one, and a driver told the tank fills to a
  hundred percent without being told that plans a race that does not work.

Everything else rounds towards more fuel: running out is a retirement and
carrying a spare litre is a tenth a lap.

Fuel reaches `Car` for **the player's car only**, because the sims publish tank
telemetry for the car you are driving and nobody else's. It is attached by
matching `mID`, since LMU's telemetry array is indexed by `playerVehicleIdx`
while the scoring array is not. Attaching by position would put your tank on
whichever car happened to be scored in that slot.

## Being away from the wheel

The engineer says nothing, and **records nothing**, when the driver is not
driving. Three states, and they need three different signals:

* **Paused.** The sim's clock stops while this machine's does not, and the
  difference is the signal. `mGamePhase` read *green flag* right through a
  session sitting paused in the garage, with `mCurrentET` frozen at 2218.0. The
  phase says what kind of session it is. It says nothing about whether the
  session is running.
* **In the garage.** The clock keeps running here, so the clock cannot be the
  signal. `mInGarageStall` is. It covers less ground than `in_pits`, which is
  the whole pit lane: a car serving a stop is racing.
* **Handed to the AI.** `mControl` is 1, which is what spectating looks like.

**Nothing is observed either.** A paused sim republishes the same frame
forever, and feeding that to the lap book records a car covering no ground for
as long as somebody leaves the game sitting there. That is a corrupt reference
lap rather than a missing one. The spotter's state is dropped on the way in for
the same reason: a car that was alongside before the pause is a fact about a
moment that has gone.

**Pausing an online race is not detected, and cannot be.** The clock keeps
running there, because the race keeps running. The menu is open on this machine
and the cars are still going. Nothing in the shared memory separates that from
ordinary racing, and inventing a signal for it would silence the engineer
during a real race, which is the worse mistake of the two.
